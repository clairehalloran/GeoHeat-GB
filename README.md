# GeoHeat-GB: A power systems planning model for heat electrification in Britain

GeoHeat-GB is an open-source power systems planning model for heat electrification in Britain. This model is built on the electricity-only [PyPSA-Eur](https://pypsa-eur.readthedocs.io) open model dataset of the European power system. 

As with the PyPSA-Eur model, this model is built through a snakemake workflow. Users are referred to the [PyPSA-Eur documentation](https://pypsa-eur.readthedocs.io) for instructions on running the model.

The model uses historical temperature data to project hourly residential heating at high spatial resolution using [heating demand profiles](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Monitored_heat_pump_heat_demand_profiles_-_supplementary_information_to_Watson_et_al_2021_/13547447) based on the Renewable Heat Premium Payment trials. The development of these profiles is described in the paper [How will heat pumps alter national half-hourly heat demands? Empirical modelling based on GB field trials](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2021.110777). These profiles are used under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) and have been modified from half-hourly to hourly to match the temporal resolution of other generation and demand data used in the model.

The model uses [high spatial resolution population data](https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/documents/0995e94d-6d42-40c1-8ed4-5090d82471e1) that contains data supplied by Natural Environment Research Council. ©NERC (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology).
